# random_graph_network_art
# python version 3.10.0
# First install the dependencies with the command "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
# Run the program with the command "python3 random_graph_art.py"
# If it gets stuck kill the process and try again (A bad configuration of the positions of the objects in the drawing could cause infinite iterations, this is due to the random positioning)
# It should generate a "graph_network_art.ppm" file
