# graph_network_art

A python program that generates a randomn graph network art

It is on python 3.10.0 

## Installation

Use the package manager pip to install dependecies.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the script with the following command.

```bash
python3 random_graph_art.py
```
If it gets stuck kill the process and try again (A bad configuration of the positions of the objects in the drawing could cause infinite iterations, this is due to the random positioning)

It should generate the following file:

```bash
graph_network_art.ppm
```
There are some examples generated by the script with names:

```bash
example1.ppm example2.ppm example3.ppm
```
